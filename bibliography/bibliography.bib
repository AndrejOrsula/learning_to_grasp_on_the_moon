  abstract = {A key challenge in intelligent robotics is creating
              robots that are capable of directly interacting with
              the world around them to achieve their goals. The
              last decade has seen substantial growth in research
              on the problem of robot manipulation, which aims to
              exploit the increasing availability of affordable
              robot arms and grippers to create robots capable of
              directly interacting with the world to achieve their
              goals. Learning will be central to such autonomous
              systems, as the real world contains too much
              variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate
              model of its environment, the objects in it, or the
              skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We
              aim to survey a representative subset of that
              research which uses machine learning for
              manipulation. We describe a formalization of the
              robot manipulation learning problem that synthesizes
              existing research into a single coherent framework
              and highlight the many remaining research
              opportunities and challenges.},
